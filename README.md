# Events-Manager

* I created two html web pages, the first one is login page, where once you fill out the form your info
will be sent to server by post method. server will verify user's information to decide if let the user sign in

* The second html page you can add events by its team name, date, location. And, a google API is added so that it's
easier for user to navigate the location.
